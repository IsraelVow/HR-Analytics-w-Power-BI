In today's dynamic business landscape, the sustenance of productivity and growth hinges significantly on an organization's investment in its human resources. Factors like the COVID-19 pandemic have reshaped the management of talent within workplaces. While HR analytics projects often aren't perceived as major determinants of employee productivity, this project delves into HR datasets to uncover insights that can significantly influence employee management and overall work productivity.

## Project Overview

This project centers on the utilization of a real HR Dataset obtained from ATLIQ, focusing on employee attendance and presence, with subsequent data analysis conducted in Power BI. The process began with comprehensive requirement gathering through direct interactions with stakeholders.

## Motivation

HR managers devote substantial time to analyzing various aspects of employee activities, relations, and compensations, all aimed at enhancing performance. However, this project goes beyond surface-level analysis by scrutinizing employee attendance to discern insights into preferred work structures amidst evolving work environments. By asking pertinent questions and leveraging HR data effectively, organizations can better tailor their strategies to meet employee preferences, whether it's remote work, hybrid models, or traditional office setups.

## Requirement Gathering

During this initial stage, active listening and stakeholder engagement were paramount. By prioritizing dialogue and asking pertinent questions, the aim was to become a strategic partner rather than a mere solution provider. Short-term and long-term plans were thoroughly discussed to align solutions accordingly.

## Steps:

### Step 1: Data Collection and Transformation

Utilizing Power Query, data was collected and transformed from multiple Excel sheets, each containing distinct column headers. The transformation process involved consolidating the sheets, transposing certain columns, and ensuring data consistency across all tables. By storing transformation steps in reusable functions, efficiency and consistency were maintained throughout.

### Step 2: Attendance Analysis

Key insights were drawn from the Attendance Key data, categorizing various types of attendance such as work from home, paid leave, or absenteeism. Analysis focused on determining the percentage of employees present during specific periods, enabling strategic decisions regarding meetings, team activities, and resource planning. Additionally, insights gleaned from attendance data facilitated capacity planning and resource allocation, optimizing organizational efficiency.

### Step 3: Sick Leave Analysis

Another crucial aspect involved analyzing sick leave patterns to gauge the overall healthiness of the workforce and identify potential seasonal ailments. By understanding the prevalence and reasons behind sick leave, organizations could proactively implement measures to safeguard employee well-being and productivity. Moreover, insights derived from sick leave data informed decision-making regarding training, seminars, and infrastructure maintenance, aligning with employee preferences and optimizing operational costs.

## Key Findings

Through meticulous analysis, several key findings emerged. For instance, a noticeable decline in employee presence was observed in June compared to April, with a corresponding increase in remote work. Moreover, sick leave instances surged during the summer month of June, indicating potential seasonal health challenges. Furthermore, analysis revealed specific weekdays when employee presence was highest, enabling informed decisions regarding scheduling of activities and initiatives requiring employee participation.

## Conclusion

This project underscores the importance of leveraging HR analytics to drive informed decision-making and enhance organizational performance. By dissecting HR datasets and extracting actionable insights, organizations can adapt their strategies to align with employee preferences and optimize resource utilization. Moving forward, ongoing analysis and refinement will be essential to ensure continued adaptability and effectiveness in workforce management.
